## Abstract

## Reasoning

Add some research on other competitors like the kickstarter one.

## How to Use

## Design Journey

### Physical Design

#### Sphere

#### Travel Mug

#### A Study in Form

### Software and Electrical Prototyping

Basic Component Selection

How did we select these items, flow off what Ethan adds for his physical design parts.

Add research on how to create heat, pumping current through the 100 Ohm resistors

Screenshots of the math.
What is the required current and voltage to heat the resistors

Initial attempts to power through the MCU

Switching to the MOSFET

Document the MOSFET issues. Specifically what happned when Vg > Vgs.
add the photos from the chat history with Ethan.

Walk through the usage of Nichrome Wire as a heating element

The switch to the heating pads to simplify the device.

Pivot to Software

What libraries are we using
copy the docs for Platform.IO usage to the appendix and reference it

Talk about ESPNow, and briefly explain the original idea for using a mobile app like the competitor.

MAC address issues can be referenced within lessons learned.

Add a refined diagram of the FSM

Explain the logic of the heating timers and such

Add a brief about how the software was originally split up
